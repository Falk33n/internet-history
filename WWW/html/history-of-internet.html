                <p class="main-p">
                    The internet is a network of devices connected globally that we use to share information. It is composed of smaller
                    networks such as businesses, governments, educational institutions and individuals. These networks connect through 
                    infrastructure, satellites and wireless connections. But when was the first network created?

                    In the <time datetime="1950">1950</time>s, US defense, research, and educational institutions created the first
                    computer network for sharing information. At that time, computers could only be connected if they were in the same
                    location. And the ability to share data was limited. However, the creation of ARPANET changed that. In the 
                    <time datetime="1980">1980</time>s, scientists created the start of what later on would become the internet we know

                <p class="main-p">
                    In <time datetime="1969">1969</time>, in the middle of the Cold War, the Pentagon's Advanced
                    Research Project Agency (ARPA) started a project called ARPANET whose goal was to create a network for computers to 
                    communicate with each other over long distances. ARPANET created a new networking system, called packet switching. 
                    This system made it possible for computers to send messages - private data packages - around the network.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    ARPANET connects computers across universities. Throughout the <time datetime="1970">70</time>s, ARPANET included 
                    more and more universities, research centers and government institutions. In the <time datetime="1980">80</time>s, 
                    ARPANET had completed its goal and was phased out. The remaining networks are the precursors of the internet today.

                <p class="main-p">
                    The first message that ARPANET sent from one computer to another in <time datetime="1969">1969</time> 
                    was a far cry from an email as we know it. The idea of sending an instant message from one device to another became 
                    so appealing that specialists developed more complex protocols for sending them. However, one thing remains 
                    - how do you indicate where the message is supposed to go to? Ray Tomlinson, an American programmer working at
                    ARPANET, came up with the answer - the “@” symbol. In <time datetime="1971">1971</time>, Tomlinson proposed to 
                    his co-workers to seperate the user's name from the receiving computer with an “@”, addressing the messages' 
                    “username@name of the computer. This is how we've addressed emails ever since.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the beginning, email was used to communicate within internal networks of universities. But the creation of it was
                    so useful that programmers started developing a way to send emails to computers outside of the internal network. As
                    the internet grew, it became an integral part of professional communication.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Email began spreading in the <time datetime="1990">1990</time>s with the rise of internet service providers (ISPs) 
                    offering free email services to people. Web-based email services such as Hotmail and Yahoo Mail contributed to 
                    email's popularity. At the beginning of the <time datetime="2000">2000</time>, email had already become a 
                    daily mode of communication.

                <p class="main-p">
                    Until <time datetime="1983">1983</time>, ARPANET computers used NCP (Network Control Protocol) to communicate with one
                    another. Though NCP had limits and was not suitable for connecting different types of computer networks. 
                    To solve this, developers created the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol). TCP/IP was more 
                    flexible and could connect to different types of computer networks, which in return enabled better communication.       
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The transition from NCP to TCP/IP was gradual since the network infrastructure was in need of an update.
                    Special translators, known as protocol gateways, were created in aid of computers that still used NCP, to communicate
                    with those who were using TCP/IP.

                <p class="main-p">
                    To understand the importance of DNS, let's look at what an IP address is. An IP address, or an internet protocol
                    address, is a unique string of characters that identifies each separate computer communicating over the internet.     
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the early days, network hosts (computers that were communicating with one another on the network) were identified by
                    using numerical IP addresses, for example, 192.0.2.1. With time, the internet grew and it became impractical to 
                    remember all IP addresses. This is where DNS (Domain Name System) comes to play.  
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    DNS was created back in <time datetime="1984">1984</time> to translate human-readable domain names into IP addresses. 
                    It acts like an address book. It's easier to remember domain names rather than complicated strings of numbers.

                    AOL (formerly known as America Online) started back in <time datetime="1985">1985</time> and rebranded to AOL in 
                    <time datetime="1991">1991</time>. It was an online service provider that was the start of the consumer internet. AOL
                    provided easy-to-access online platforms which introduced the internet to millions of people.

                    which allowed people at home to connect using their phone lines. Online chat rooms and communities are flooded with 
                    users, creating social interactions online. The internet started to become what it is today.

                    was among the earliest ones which started serving customers back in <time datetime="1989">1989</time>. 
                    Established by Joel Furr, it started by providing direct connection to the internet in the San Francisco Bay area. 
                    Until then, the internet was mainly used by military, research, and educational institutions and businesses. 
                    The world gives users internet access to home.

                    <br>
                    The World offered their services for a fee that provided user-friendly tools and interfaces for navigating WWW,
                    including one of the first web browsers, The Web Explorer. The World contributed greatly world the growth of the 
                    internet by offering services like email, newsgroups, online chats, and file sharing for a larger audience.

                    community, but also to businesses and home users. This is what made the internet so widespread that it is today. 
                    These decades saw a lot of firsts: the first photo, the first web page, the first webcam, the first social media 
                    platform, the invention of Wi-Fi and Google.

                    Back then, the internet mainly consisted of FTP sites where users could download files. Archie created an index of
                    files on FTP (File Transfer Protocol) sites. Archie would scan FTP servers and create databases of file names that
                    were searchable. The users would search for a specific file by their names.

                    <br>
                    Archie could, however, not search for content within web pages and would index only specific file format.
                    Archie laid the grounds for more advanced search engines of the <time datetime="1990">90</time>s such as Gopher, Veronika, and Jughead, that began 
                    to index content on the web. These all led to landmark search engines, such as Web Crawler

                    The dot-com bubble was a stock market bubble which burst in the early <time datetime="2000">2000</time>s, impacting
                    internet and technology-related stocks of the so-called dot-com companies, primarily based in the United States.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the late <time datetime="1990">1990</time>s, seeing the potential of the internet and an eagerness to capitalize on it,
                    venture capitalists and private investors poured money into the hyped-up industry, and stock prices of dot-com companies
                    skyrocketed. Most of these companies would not generate a sustainable revenue. This led to the stock market decline 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Over-evaluation was one of the top reasons why the dot-com bubble burst. Most of the companies in the dot-com bubble were
                    valued too high based on their future expectations rather than present-day reality. Investors started to sell off their
                    stocks, funding eventually dried up and that led to job losses and an economic downturn. Eventually, internet companies
                    recovered and ensured more sustainable growth.

                <p class="main-p">
                    Wikipedia is one of the most used online encyclopedias. It was created back in <time datetime="2001">2001</time> by Jimmy
                    Wales and Larry Sanger, authors of an earlier web-based encyclopedia called Nupedia which hosted expert-written articles.
                    Nupedia saw slow progress and this inspired the authors to develop a way to create content faster. So they came up with
                    the concept of a collaborative, community-driven website.  
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Wikipedia allows the users to edit, add and modify the content using a simple text-coding system. As long as you have
                    internet access, you can contribute by writing or editing articles. The editors are encouraged to quote only reliable 
                    sources and have a neutral point of view.     
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Soon after the launch, many individuals volunteered in the project, this turned Wikipedia into a valuable resource for
                    research. Today, Wikipedia contains millions of articles, covering a wide range of topics. Wikipedia is also available in
                    over 300 languages.

                    MySpace is one of the biggest social networking platforms, launched back in <time datetime="2003">2003</time> by
                    Tom Anderson and Chris DeWolfe. Users of MySpace can create personalized profiles, connect with family and friends,
                    and share photos or music.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A MySpace feature at that time was that users could customize their profiles through HTML and CSS coding. The users could
                    create unique online identities. This also meant that profile pages were less streamlined than others, at that time, at that 
                    time.      
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    MySpace also plays a role in the music industry by providing the platform needed for independent and upcoming artists to
                    share their music. Over 10,000 songs were uploaded daily in its peak years.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    MySpace's growth peaked back in <time datetime="2006">2006</time>, surpassing even Google as the most-visited site in the US.
                    In <time datetime="2008">2008</time>, Facebook overtook MySpace's lead, leaving MySpace struggling to maintain its user base.
                    In internet history, MySpace is important for making the concept of connecting over the internet with one another popular.
                    Today, MySpace is still used by several million people.

                <p class="main-p">
                    Digg was a social news website that allowed the users to share newsworthy content. It was created back in 
                    <time datetime="2004">2004</time> by its founders Kevon Rose, Owen Byrne, Ron Gorodetzky and Jay Adelson. Digg offered
                    a novel type of content for content discovery by enabling users to submit links to blog posts, images, videos, and news
                    articles. The site was based on how the community voted on the content, making the most popular news rise to the top of the
                    wep page. This model of community-curated content was called "crowdsurfing". 
                    <br>

                    In <time datetime="2008">2008</time> Digg became the most visited website on the internet. The voting system that Digg
                    invented was new at the time. This empowered the users to have a direct impact on the content. It was also a door for
                    smaller publishers to get their news out. Digg unfortunately dug its own grave in <time datetime="2010">2010</time>
                    by redesigning the website by adding an algorithmic content ranking system, which led to user backlash. Most users                
                    moved on to other websites, such as Reddit.

                    In <time datetime="2007">2007</time>, the iPhone launched. This changed the landscape of the mobile web. The iPhone
                    offered a user-friendly multi-touch interface which immediately popularized touchscreen smartphones, encouraging 
                    competitors to develop similar devices. Android came up with their version of it just a year later.

                    <br>
                    The iPhone also provided users with a powerful web browser, Safari, that allowed the users to browse the internet on
                    their phones, changing the limited experience to a desktop-like one. This has led to web developers focusing on responsive
                    designs, ensuring that users can access websites on their phones with different screen sizes. Over time, HTML, CSS3 and
                    JavaScript enabled the creation of a more interactive mobile web experience. For the users, this meant a much easier
                    and enjoyable way to access the internet.

                    <br>
                    Apple also created an app called the App Store, which allowed third-party app developers to distribute applications for 
                    the iPhone, paving for the new era of mobile software development. Basically, Apple introduced a market for developers to
                    present their apps.

                <p class="main-p">
                    Back in <time datetime="2008">2008</time>, the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was invented by a programmer or group of
                    programmers under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, who published a whitepaper outlining Bitcoin's concept and framework.
                    It wasn't until <time datetime="2009">2009</time> became functional, with the mining of the first block, known as
                    the "Genesis block".

                    <br>
                    Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency operating outside the control of authorities like governments. This digital asset was one
                    step ahead of its predecessors since it introduced a decentralized ledger called blockchain, recording all transactions
                    made with Bitcoin and keeping a record of history and ownership, which eliminated double-spending issues. The mechanism used
                    for validating network participants, ensured a limited supply of 21 million coins, and pseudonymized all transactions,
                    preventing fraudulent transactions.

                    <br>
                    Its success transformed the whole financial landscape and inspired other creators to develop alternative cryptocurrencies.

                <p class="main-p">
                    The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a non-profit organization that helps keep the internet
                    secure, stable and unified globally by coordinating the Internet's domain name system (DNS), IP address allocation, and
                    protocol parameter assignment. ICANN is a partnership consisting of people all around the world, formed back in                
                    <time datetime="1998">1988</time> and operates under the principles of multi-stakeholder governance.

                    <br>
                    In <time datetime="2009">2009</time>, ICANN changed several policies that significantly impacted domain name registration
                    but also the general management of the internet:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </p>

                    <li>
                        The new generic top-level domain (gTLD) program that increased the stability of domain name options, which
                        allowed for customized domain extensions.
                    </li>
                    <li>    
                        The Fast-track Process for Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) introduced domain names that included non-Latin characters,
                        which allowed for greater linguistic inclusivity on the internet.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A revised version of the Registrar Accreditation Agreement (RAA) enhanced consumer security, protection, accountability,
                        and transparency within the domain name registration system.        
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Improved WHOIS (a publicly accessible database containing information about domain name registrants) accuracy requirements 
                        fought off spam, intellectual property infringement, and domain name abuse.

                    <br>
                    These changes made the domain name registration process more available, contributing to linguistic inclusions and diversity

                <p class="main-p">
                    Throughout the pandemic, people learned, worked, communicated, and entertained themselves from home, using online tools.
                    Work moved to platforms like Microsoft Teams, Zoom, and Google Meet. Educational institutions shifted to e-learning
                    platforms like Microsoft Teams or Google Classroom for education. Virtual webinars and classrooms became the new norm.

                    Entertainment also got focused on being more online. Streaming services experienced an increase in users, and online 
                    gaming thrived. Suffering from social isolation, people started to come to social media platforms more and more to stay
                    up to date with family and friends.

                    This large dependence on the internet increased the cybercrime rates all over the internet. This highlighted the
                    importance of cybersecurity. Technologies like antimalware software and antivirus, prevention systems and intrusion
                    detection, multi-factor authentication, and VPNs have become a necessity for users of the internet.

                    Since internet speed has increased with the wide adoption of 5G, global connectivity is bound to grow. There are
                    predictions that the Internet of Things will grow as well, connecting even more devices and enabling smart homes,
                    vehicles, cities, and industries. The increase in connectivity and usage of smart devices is bound to create better
                    security and privacy solutions.

                    People's work and entertainment processes are also expected to change with technologies such as augmented reality
                    and virtual reality transforming the way we consume content, work, and interact on the web. And with AI on the rise,
                    we'll see what future the internet brings us.

                <h2 class="main-h2">PERSONAL ANALYSIS</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="main-p">
                    The history of the internet is, by my personal opinion, so fun to learn about. I love to learn about technology and
                    this project is certainly one of them. The internet affects myself in various ways. I use it to educate myself, watch 
                    videos, chat on platforms, and to use social media. Without the internet I can't even think of what my life would look 
                    like. In this section I will give you those who are reading an analysis of the sections on this web page: I really think 
                    it's interesting how ARPA created the ARPANET. How they could do this at that age of time is mind-blowing to me and it's 
                    interesting to learn about what data packages are. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It's also fun to learn that it was mainly distributed to military and 
                    universities. It was very interesting to learn about when and how the first email was sent. How the idea of an instant 
                    message evolved into reality. It was also fascinating to learn that ISPs are what laid the foundation for email 
                    services such as Yahoo Mail and Hotmail. I think it is really cool how Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf could create TCP/IP and 
                    that the creation of DNS made it much easier to navigate throughout the internet with domain names instead of IP 
                    addresses. I also think that the launch of AOL is very interesting since it was the foundation for providing 
                    internet services. This basically was the foundation to the reason you even use the internet today. The creation of the 
                    IRC is really cool as well, since this was the foundation for direct messaging that we all use today. I also really find 
                    the creation of the World Wide Web to be interesting. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I also admire Tim Berner-Lee very much and think that his creations 
                    really laid the foundation of my life as of today. It's really cool to learn that he is the one who created things such
                    as HTML, HTTP, and URI. Learning about the ISP "The World" was also very fascinating since this really is where the 
                    internet became public and shaped the internet's accessibility. Learning about the first search engine, Archie, was 
                    also very cool. To learn about that it mainly consisted of FTP sites really shows how much, for example, Google has 
                    evolved today if you compare them. The launch of the first webcam also made me excited, since Quentin and Paul laid the 
                    foundation for something that I use almost everyday every day since I'm studying to become a Web Developer and the 
                    studies are online-based. Learning how governments wanted to have a say about the internet, I really think want 
                    good since, without proper laws for it, it can really become a dangerous place. I think that this statement really 
                    goes to show if you compare normal WWW with, for example, the Dark Web. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    Learning about the start of e-commerce and the 
                    social media is really interesting since this is what we use today and I believe that many people would be "lost" 
                    without these inventions being created. Learning about the launch of Google made me thrilled every day since Google 
                    is something I use every day in my life to learn about information and so on. Page and Brin are really inspiring 
                    people for me, since they are such smart and talented people. It was also nice to learn why the heck it was called 
                    Google ha ha.
                    
                    Learning that dot-com stocks were even a thing, I had no clue about. It was a fun story to hear about that it eventually
                    crashed but later on revived itself to a more stable form. Learning about the start of Wikipedia, MySpace and Digg was 
                    really interesting of the latter I had actually not heard not actually. Wikipedia is something that I use sometimes and 
                    definitely is a really good tool sometimes (as long as the sources are reliable). MySpace is actually, even though at 
                    my age of 23 years old, something I was a user of in my early days on this earth ha ha. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Digg I have never heard of and 
                    learning that it dug its own grave was interesting since I believe that many companies and websites have made this 
                    mistake. Learning about the ICANN policy change back in <time datetime="2009">2009</time> was interesting aswell, since 
                    it made domain name registration really simplified but also limited it to not being abused. Reading about the 
                    <time datetime="2010">2010</time>s-present day is not so much that I learned from, but nice to read about analyzing 
                    how the most current changes actually happened, since when you're in the middle of evolution you really dont sit back 
                    and reflect on the changes happening.                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I think that this story was really interesting to learn about and I hope that you also think
                    that, thanks for me, and I hope you have a nice day!
