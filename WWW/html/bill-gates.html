                    family and had an older brother and a younger sister, his father, William H. Gates II, and his mother, Mary Gates, who was a school teacher and 
                    eventually became a homemaker.

                <p class="main-p">
                    Gates oversaw Microsoft's transformation from a startup to a global technology giant. Gates leads the race for being
                    the best-known entrepreneur for the personal computers indusry. Forbes magazine has ranked Bill as the richest man
                    on earth for several years. What many people don't know is that Gates has actually also released several books.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Gates went to public elementary school and, later, on, the private Lakeside School in Seattle, US. In eighth grade, Lakeside's administrators 
                    discovered that Gates had hacked the school computer system to get free time on the mainframe. He was later arrested for this and spent a whole 
                    night in jail. Gates has later on said that this event was "the single biggest influence on my career".

                    Gates graduated from Lakeside back in <time datetime="1973">1973</time> and enrolled at Harvard University. Though, two years later, he dropped out, 
                    to pursue his business career. In <time datetime="1975">1975</time>, Gates and Paul Allen co-founded Microsoft in Alburerque, New Mexico, US. The 
                    first product they developed was a version of the BASIC programming language for the Altair 8800. The Altair was one of the first commercially 
                    available microcomputers on the market. In <time datetime="1980">1980</time>, they released its MS-DOS operating system for IBM's personal computers.
                    This was a major breakthrough for Microsoft, since IBM's PCs became the industry standard.

                    In addition to the Gates foundation, Gates has also been active in global health initiatives. He serves on boards of several organizations, 
                    including the GAVI Alliance and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. Bill has been criticized for his involvement in some of 
                    these organizations, particularly the GAVI Alliance, since that organization has been accused of promoting vaccination programs in developing 
                    countries that are not based on scientific evidence.

                <br>
                <p class="main-p">
                    In an interview back in <time datetime="1995">1995</time>, Gates predicted that, within a decade, people would regularly watch TV shows, movies and
                    other entertainment online. In fact, 10 years later, in <time datetime="2005">2005</time>, YouTube was created. Two years later, Netflix was founded.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Gates missed the mark when the interviewer suggested that the internet could become a rifle of misinformation that could easily spread to large
                    amounts of people. Bill Gates was doubtful that the internet would become a repository for what might now be known as "fake news". He argued that
                    having more opportunities to verify information by authorities would balance out the spread of misinformation.

                <h2 class="main-h2">PERSONAL ANALYSIS</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="main-p">
                    I believe that this story about Bill Gates is rather fascinating, how he became one of the wealthiest people on the earth and the creation of
                    Microsoft. I already knew about a lot of the things that are brought up in this section but it was nice with a quick reminder of it.
                    I did not know so much about his younger years, which was nice to learn about, and I found it really funny that he hacked the school computers 
                    system ha ha. Learning about the different creations that Bill Gates is the founder of is really mind-blowing. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Bill Gates has impacted the whole 
                    world with his creations and I'm actually right now writing this, using a computer that has Windows 11 as an operating system. Without Bill Gates'
                    creations, I think that technology really wouldn't be where it's at today. I can't think of a world without Microsoft's creations. Maybe PCs that 
                    we know of today will never be invented. I think that without Gates' creations, the world today would be set-back to the times before Microsoft's 
                    founding. It was also nice to learn together that Bill Gates, together with others, tried to help the world by donating large amounts of their 
                    wealth to help the world survive and advance. Reading about Microsoft's failures was also interesting. Many of these creations I have actually 
                    never heard about, such as Microsoft Kin and Microsoft Surface. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With all great tech-companies there are bound to be failures along the way, but 
                    no one can say that Bill Gates is not a successful business executive. It was also fun to hear about the predictions Gates made back in 
                    <time datetime="1995">1995</time> and that he was so wrong about the risk of the internet being used as a source of misinformation. This has now 
                    spread all over the internet today as well. Therefore, it's advised to be cautious and think one extra time after reading something on the internet.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I think that this story was really interesting to learn about and I hope that you also think
                    that, thanks for me, and I hope you have a nice day!
