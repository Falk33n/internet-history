                    In the past, websites were seen as digital fancy business cards. Today, however, they are immersive digital experiences that create wealth - in some
                    cases, being the only revenue generation source (e.g., e-commerce).

                    <br>
                    When designing websites, if the user were to only have 15 minutes to view your content, two-thirds of them would visit an aesthetically pleasing
                    website instead.
                    <br>
                    Users are more likely to leave your website if it's designed poorly, with just under half of users in a survey saying that design is the most
                    crucial part in determining a brand's trustworthiness.

                    Agile web design process is an evolution of a mix of waterfall and traditional design approaches and considers the extremely competitive and dynamic
                    online environment.
                    <br>
                    This section will dive deep into the web design process, underscoring key departures from other process types but also showing the benefits of using
                    it.

                <p class="main-p">
                    The agile methodology is a SCRUM-based incremental, iterative way to software development or web design that prioritizes continuous delivery over
                    linear, step-based milestones, and rigid objectives. In this approach, the designers work in short sprints (for one to two weeks) to quickly
                    test and prototype new features at every step of the project.

                    <br>
                    The agile web design process directs the designers to release their designs and get real-time feedback from the users and stakeholders early,
                    this provides a chance to make changes quickly. The result of an agile web design development methodology is an agile project that includes
                    detailed feedback whilst sticking to short timelines.

                    During the process, priorities and options must be weighted, with each choice impeding or speeding up the workflow.

                    Though it's not always clear what approach is the best, the agilemethod offers four core principles that determine what to prioritize during

                <p class="main-p">
                    Three options are on the table in any web design scenario: traditional, waterfall or agile web design.
                    Though traditional web development is archaic, some companies still choose to use it, often when website design changes
                    are internal. Agile and waterfall fall under modern web design, both with their unique nuances. In the picture you can
                    see the differences between the processes.

                <p class="main-p">
                    Traditional website design is often an internally-driven process. A company hires a web design agency. However, 
                    they call all the shots regarding functionality, testing, design, execution, etc. This type of design is outdated since 
                    it doesn't consider the customer at all. The main difference between agile and traditional is that agile is user-centred 
                    whilst traditional is company-centred.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The waterfall method for designing websites is a future-driven process that tackles one step at a time, hence the 
                    waterfall or cascading motif. Though this approach is goal-driven, it falls in its lack of flexibility. The main risks 
                    are that any issues early on in the process hold up the rest of the steps, leading to project delays. The main 
                    difference between agile and waterfall is that agile is iterative and flexible, whilst a waterfall is rigid and linear.

                    The agile web development process has multiple steps that usually co-occur. The process relies on teamwork, and
                    early team meetings are crucial for the project's success. Instead of following a long design process, agile
                    involves sprints -- each with a timeline and unique goal.

                        <b>Goals</b><br>
                        The first step is to set clear goals. What is the team trying to achieve with their website? What needs to be
                        included on the site? Who is the targeted audience? Answering these questions helps to create clear goals for the team.

                    <li>    
                        <b>Ideation</b><br>
                        The second step is to come up with ideas for meeting the goals. The assembled development and design team brainstorms
                        with other stakeholders to explore innovative and new ideas for the project.

                        The third step is to plan how to make the first and second steps reality. It involves creating a plan for the
                        project covering user wireframes, flows, and prototypes to help the team visualize the website. It is also
                        essential to keep the customers in mind but also, if possible, involve during this step to ensure that the final
                        product meets their needs.

                        <b>Sprint</b><br>
                        A sprint means having a short, focused period (usually 2-4 weeks) where the team works on a specific goal.
                        This goal could be anything from adding new features or designing the home page. During the sprints, staying
                        focused is crucial.

                        <b>Iterate</b><br> 
                        After each sprint, the team takes a step back and subjects the outcome of the sprint to user-centric analysis,
                        feedback, and testing. Data collected from the functionality and feedback metrics is placed back into the process 
                        whether this informs the team whether to continue or tweak the design more. During this step, the focus is to not 
                        get stuck and keep the progression going.     
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Production</b><br>
                        Once all the goals for the project have been met, the design is usually production-ready and can move on further to
                        the development phase. This might seem like the end of the process. However, the concept of agile assumes that
                        this step can go backwards to any previous steps, depending on any new information arising.

                        <b>Transparency</b><br>
                        The main benefits of agile is that it is a transparent process. Every single one of the team members knows what
                        needs to be done and when, helping each other and keeping everyone on track.

                    <li>    
                        <b>Faster Launch</b><br>
                        Since agile involves sprints, the project tends to move along faster since the sprints have a specific timeline and
                        goals.

                    <li>
                        <b>Improved Quality and Customer Satisfaction</b><br>  
                        Agile involves getting feedback from the users early on product helps with improving the final products quality, 
                        leading to customer satisfaction rising.

                    <li>
                        <b>Focus on Core Project Deliverables</b><br>
                        An advantage of agile web design is that it assists the team to focus on the most crucial aspects of the project,
                        allowing for better use of results and resources in a higher-quality product.
                    </li>  
                    <li>
                        <b>Reduced Risk</b><br> 
                        Agile inherently reduces the risk since changes can be made quickly based on the feedback from the user, this
                        helps avoid costly mistakes and keep the project on track.

                        <b>Cost Savings</b><br>
                        Agile web design can also lead to cost savings due to an adoptable and flexible process structure. The team can 
                        make changes easily and quickly without a high cost.

                        <b>Easy Adaptation to Change</b><br> 
                        Agile is all about flexibility, it's easy to adapt to new requirements, circumstances, or data. This is
                        especially beneficial when run as a data-driven process.

                    <li>
                        <b>Better Communication</b><br>
                        Better communication is a hallmark of the agile web design process. It encourages open communication in the team,
                        between the customer, and stakeholders throughout the process. This helps avoid misunderstandings in
                        communication and keep everyone on the same page.

                    Despite the benefits, there is also some limitations to using an agile web design process:

                            Agile process requires a team led by a certified SCRUM master that embraces and understands the agile
                            methodology. Christening and recruiting a team an agile team can do more harm than good since the process
                            will be marred with delays, misunderstandings, and general confusion.

                            <b>Not Always Suitable for Large Projects</b><br>
                            Agile web design can be challenging to scale up in larger projects since the process relies heavily on
                            the user's feedback. In large projects with many stakeholders, it can be challenging to keep soliciting input
                            from many different people.

                            <b>It can lead to Scope Creep</b><br>
                            One danger with agile is that sometimes it can lead to scope creep (the projects time increasing over time), especially
                            when a team continues to make changes based on the feedback from the users without considering the overall impact
                            on the project. A never-ending backlog and scope creep are the leading reasons  why projects take longer time 
                            than expected and go over budget.

                <p class="main-p">
                    It was really interesting to get an insight into how agile web design works and what the agile process consists of.
                    It was also fascinating to read about the surveys that showed how much web design really impacts the user's satisfaction.
                    I do believe that agile is the best methodology to use, especially in the web design industry, since it offers
                    great contact not only in the team but also with the customer and stakeholders. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was good to learn the processes of 
                    agile, since I believe that many of the subjects are really good and I understand why so many use agile as a methodology.
                    Learning about the waterfall and traditional processes really made me believe even more that agile is the way to go,
                    since both of these have more disadvantages than advantages, if you ask me. One of the steps of the agile process is 
                    sprints, which I have recently learned about in school where we are going to have regular occurring sprints on projects.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Learning about both the benefits and limitations of agile web design made me think that the advantages overtake the
                    disadvantages, since the agile process is really easy to understand when you have started working with it.

                    I think that this story was really interesting to learn about and I hope that you also think
                    that, thanks for me, and I hope you have a nice day!
